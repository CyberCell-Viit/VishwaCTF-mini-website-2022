        <p class="left">CyberCell, VIIT is a tight-knit group of students aiming to study and learn more about the CyberSecurity domain, and with this aim, we are constantly trying to upgrade ourselves by working collaboratively on various activities. One of these is the annual CTF by the name VishwaCTF. And, this year we are also rolling out the VishwaCTF-Mini to help beginners get a try of the CTF Field before taking on the main VishwaCTF.
        </p>

        <p class="center">CyberCell, VIIT has always been a group of highly energetic individuals since its inception in 2013. And, we have come under the umbrella of CyberCell, VIIT for a common purpose - To make the Indian CyberSecurity Scene more exciting, indigenuously. The VIshwaCTF-Mini also is an event undertaken for the same purpose. We want India to create lots of highly skilled CyberSecurity experts, and we want to be a part of that group too. So here we are, taking the first step towards that goal. Come Join Us!

            VishwaCTF is the Flagship event of CyberCell, VIIT. At its inception, it was the first CTF from Maharashtra, India. And also, the second one from India organized independently by any college. Now, we again aim for higher heights going global with the 3rd Edition of VishwaCTF.
            At the same time, we also want to develop the CyberSecurity scene in India. And thats why, we chose to run a beginner-friendly CTF in the form of VishwaCTF-Mini before the main VishwaCTF so that there is more space to learn.
